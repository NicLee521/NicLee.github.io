                        I am a student at Becker College currently working towards my BA in Interactive Media Design with a Computer Programming focus. I have minors in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am very passionate about video
                        games and all things computers. I am a huge sucker for strategy games such as the Total War and Fire Emblem series. I started coding at a relativley late stage in my life during my senior year of highschool but 
                        I fell in love with it instantly. Though I may not have started coding as early as I would've liked to, I've always been around computers though as most of my generation has. I've worked in a variety of languages 
                        and different engines such as the Unity and Unreal engines. I really enjoy making base game mechanics and I have a couple years experience with networking due to a twin stick shooter moba that a team of other students
                        and I worked on during my sophmore and junior years of college.

                <p>
                    Worked as the programming lead for a student project named LAW (Legends and Warfare). A lot of my responsibilities included making sure my team was on time during sprints and selecting which individuals to work
                    on what to work on based off of their indiviual strengths while also working on my own tasks for the project as well. I would also report the teams progress to the professor in charge and have meetings with other leads
                    to figure out what needs to be done and set goals up for sprints. I would also do reviews for each of my team members to grade their progress so that they would get a grade in the studio.

                            One of my main projects I've been working on since I've started college. It is an entirely networked twin-stick shooter MOBA with 5 different characters, each with 3 different abilities each. It is entirely done by 
                            students all around my age and many whom I've now worked with for 2 years and have become great friends with. It has all the elements as any normal MOBA would with towers, minions (or creeps), and a destroyable base(or nexus).
                            It also has the same progression as any other MOBA with the players having to destroy the towers until you make it to the enemies base where you can then destroy their base and win the game.

                            A friend and I joined up to create this boss battle game for a game jam in August of 2017. He worked on the art and a few of the mechanics while I worked on a majority of the boss mechanics and a few of the character movement mechanics.
                            It was a blast to work on though we might not have completely finished it we were proud of what we created.
