                        Legends and Warfare is a project I put a lot of work into during my sophmore and junior year of college. I worked on quite a few things such as fog of war, MOBA towers, helping with
						networking player abilities, networking ai MOBA minions, and many other general tasks. I also put time in as the programming lead during one semseter as I wrote on the previous page. 
						Follows are a couple examples of the stuff I worked on throughout the duration of this project.

                <p>
                    Worked as the programming lead for a student project named LAW (Legends and Warfare). A lot of my responsibilities included making sure my team was on time during sprints and selecting which individuals to work
                    on what to work on based off of their indiviual strengths while also working on my own tasks for the project as well. I would also report the teams progress to the professor in charge and have meetings with other leads
                    to figure out what needs to be done and set goals up for sprints. I would also do reviews for each of my team members to grade their progress so that they would get a grade in the studio.
