                        Quite possibly one of my oldest displayable projects is some work I did for a game jam in the summer of 2017. The theme of the game jam was 30 second boss fights or something along those lines. I worked with one other friend
                        who did most of the art and player stuff while I mainly did most of the boss abilities and mechanics. It was a ton of fun to do and everything worked pretty well but unfortunately I no longer have the project and can't find videos of any of the features. 
						But here are some snippets of code that I managed to find.

        <h2 class="heading">Code Examples</h2>
                <h3 id= "JA">Jump Ability</h3>
				<div style = "width:600px;overflow:auto;margin:auto;">
                <p>
                    The jump ability that the boss had would allow him to jump from the left side of the level to the right side of the level and vice versa.
					At the end of each jump the boss would do explosion damage to the player if they were within a certain distance. The boss would jump 
					between sides at a set interval so that the player would learn the mechanics and timing of the boss.
                </p>
				</div>
				<img src = "images/Jump.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
				<h3 id = "EA">Entanglement Ability</h3>
				<div style = "width:600px;overflow:auto;margin:auto;">
                <p>
                    The entanglement ability of the boss works exactly like it reads. It entangles the player and doesnt allow them to move for a certain amount of time.
					This ability is also at a set interval so that the player will be able to learn and adapt to not jumping at those times.
                </p>
				</div>
				<img src = "images/Entan.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
				<h3 id = "PDA">Platform Destroy Ability</h3>
				<div style = "width:600px;overflow:auto;margin:auto;">
                <p>
                    The platform destroy ability of the boss is quite self explantory. The script searches for a any random moving platform in the game and destroys that platform
					whether or not the player is on it. It also plays an animation of the boss looking towards the platform he is about to destroy which allows the player to
					see which platform is getting destroyed and jump to another.
                </p>
